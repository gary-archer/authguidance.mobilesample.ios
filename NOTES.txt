TODO

1. Okta to get working and use logout strategies
   Logout errors to ignore as for SPA and desktop samples
   Update iPad certs and test Okta on a real device

2. Long press to invoke 500 error - will require a boolean field in the published event
   Can I change to an Orientation Handler approach with published data pushed to onReceive handlers???
   API client to receive and use request options
   Ensure that error views are centred in both portrait and landscape - including modal dialog

4. Stack traces to improve
   Pass stack traces to uiError from system errors

INTERSTITIAL PAGE PROBLEM
-------------------------
1. iOS and return after login
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/356
   https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/232
   Second scene constructor is called when I open a custom scheme URL from a browser
   For now I've removed interstitial page and Auth Server returns directly to custom scheme URL

DEEP LINK SETUP
---------------
1. Online file hosted in S3 and available over this CloudFront URL.
   Edit metadata of S3 file and set Content-Type=application/json.
   https://authguidance-examples.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

2. Entitlements.plist enables app links

3. Under XCode / Targets / Signing + Capabilities / Associated Domains, set this:
   applinks:authguidance-examples.com

4. Bundle identifier under Targets / Signing + Capabilities is as follows:
   com.authguidance.basicmobileapp

5. Verify the applink on this site, using the team id as the Apple App Prefix:
   https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/#resultsbox

6. Test with this command on a simulator:
   xcrun simctl openurl booted https://authguidance-examples.com#company=2

7. Troubleshoot by uninstalling app from simulator, then running the MacOS Console tool.
   Filter on app-site and you may see an error like this.
   In my case this was due to SSL trust problems when running the Charles proxy.
